# Breast Tumor Classification
In this project we created a model that could classify an ultrasound image of a breast tumor based on its characteristics using [Pyradiomics](https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

This project was written in Python 3.7 and it is intended for versions 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

The [Ultrasound Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset?datasetId=1209633&sortBy=voteCount) was provided by Kaggle.
