# Breast-Tumor-Classification
In this project we created a model that could classify an ultrasound image of a breast tumor based on its characteristics

This project was written in Python 3.7 and it is intended for versions 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

The ultrasound images dataset was provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset?datasetId=1209633&sortBy=voteCount).
