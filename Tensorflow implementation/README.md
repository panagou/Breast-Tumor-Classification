#Tensorflow implementation

Using Tensorflow we tried to create a Convolutional Neural Network that could classify the breast tumor ultrasound images. We wanted to compaire our results with our previous models and see if we could achive better accuracy using a deep learning method.

Firstly, we imported the images and made a trainig set (402 images of tumor masks, 201 of each type) and a holdout set (10 masks of malignant tumors and 65 masks of benign tumors).
